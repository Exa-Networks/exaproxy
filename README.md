ExaProxy is a a high-performance non-caching proxy. It is able to filter HTTP traffic using your favorite programming language.

It is part of Exa Networks' [SurfProtect](http://www.surfprotect.co.uk/) solution.

Exaproxy is used in production since early 2013, and proxies millions of URL per day, one installation sees Gb/s of HTTP traffic, with hundreds of Mb/s per server, and several tens of thousands of connections per machine, but this does not mean our work is finished. We continue to improve it.

ExaProxy was born out by necessity. No other open source proxy has the same features [RFC compliance](https://github.com/Exa-Networks/exaproxy/wiki/RFC)

This  [presentation](http://www.uknof.org.uk/uknof22/Mangin-ExaProxy.pdf) explains why other solutions were not suitable.

Development is done on python 2.7. This program has no dependencies on third party libraries and will run out of the box on any Unix system.

Tested with [Co-Advisor](http://coad.measurement-factory.com/). We are failing HTTP/1.0 conversion requirement and responses modifications (which we do not support as we assume that both the client and server are valid HTTP/1.1 implementation).


## Get it

```sh
> wget https://codeload.github.com/Exa-Networks/exaproxy/tar.gz/1.2.1
> tar xzvf 1.2.1
> cd exaproxy-1.2.1
> ./sbin/exaproxy
```

will give you a working proxy on port 3128

```sh
> ./sbin/exaproxy -h
```

will give you a definition of all the configuration options

```sh
> env exaproxy.tcp4.port=8088./sbin/exaproxy -de

exaproxy.tcp4.port='8088'
```
or
```sh
> export exaproxy_tcp4_port=8088
> ./sbin/exaproxy -de

exaproxy.tcp4.port='8088'
```

To change from the command line and see what options were changed from their default configuration values in the configuration file.
